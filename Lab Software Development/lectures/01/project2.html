		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text 
		of the printing and typesetting 
		industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
		the industry's standard dummy text
		ever since the 1500s, when an 
		unknown printer took a galley of 
		type and scrambled it to make a 
		type specimen book. It has 
		survived not only five centuries, 
		but also the leap into electronic 
		typesetting, remaining essentially
		unchanged. It was popularised in 
		the 1960s with the release of 
		Letraset sheets containing Lorem 
		Ipsum passages, and more recently 
		with desktop publishing software 
		like Aldus PageMaker including 
		versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
